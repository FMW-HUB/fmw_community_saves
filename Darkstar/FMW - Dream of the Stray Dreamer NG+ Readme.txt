This is a Newgame+ archive.   The features are as follows:


*A number of completed NG+2 savefiles, which has both Reimu's route (NG+) and Marisa's (NG+) completed.
*Grants a huge amount of Money, PP, and Wife Points.  More than enough to buy all upgrades and skills.
*99 of each item is available for being equipped.
*100% of the Gensokyo Chronicle completed.  Enjoy Akyu's world shattering power, to your heart's contentment.

*I recommend using the NG+ All Units mod to take your choice of ladies into the next cycle.

To install, you first must install the mod patch below.   This is because these saves may involve content that isn't in the vanilla game.   As of writing, the patch used is v1.2.2.6, but hopefully future patches would work just fine.

Secondly, take the saves folder and copy it into the folder below.

C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\fmw_dosd


That should be it.   Have fun, and thanks to the assorted modders for letting this NG+ archive be as good as it can be!
